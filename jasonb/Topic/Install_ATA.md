    The following components are installed and configured during the installation of the ATA Gateway:

    -   KB 3047154

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > -   Do not install KB 3047154 on a virtualization host. This may cause port mirroring to stop working properly.
        > -   Do not install Message Analyzer, Wireshark, or other network capture software on the ATA Gateway. If you need to capture network traffic, install and use Microsoft Network Monitor 3.4.

    -   ATA Gateway service

    -   Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable

    -   Custom Performance Monitor data collection set

5.  After the installation completes, click **Launch**  to open your browser and log in to the ATA Console.

### <a name="ConfigATAGW"></a>Step 5. Configure the ATA Gateway settings
After the ATA Gateway was installed, perform the following steps to configure the settings for the ATA Gateway.

1.  On the ATA Gateway machine, in the ATA Console, click on the **Configuration** and select the **ATA Gateways** page.

2.  Enter the following information.

    |Field|Description|Comments|
    |---------|---------------|------------|
    |Description|Enter a description of the ATA Gateway (optional).||
    |**Domain controllers** (required)<br /><br />See below for additional information about the list of controllers.|Enter the complete FQDN of your domain controller and click the plus sign to add it to the list. For example,  **dc01.contoso.com**<br /><br />![](../Image/ATAGWDomainController.png)|The objects in the first domain controller in the list will sync via LDAP queries. Depending on the size of the domain, this might take some time. **Note:** <ul><li>Make sure that the first domain controller is **not** read-only.    Read only domain controllers should be added only after the initial sync completes.</li></ul>|
    |**Capture Network adapters** (required)|Select the network adapters that are connected to the switch that are configured as the destination mirror port to receive the domain controller traffic.|Select the Capture network adapter.|
    ![](../Image/ATA_Config_GW_Settings.jpg)

3.  Click **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It will take a few minutes for the ATA Gateway service to start the first time because it builds the cache of the network capture parsers used by the ATA Gateway.

The following information applies to the servers you enter in the **Domain Controllers** list.

-   The first domain controller in the list will be used by the ATA Gateway to sync the objects in the domain via LDAP queries. Depending on the size of the domain, this might take some time.

-   All domain controllers whose traffic is being monitored via port mirroring by the ATA Gateway must be listed in the **Domain Controllers** list. If a domain controller is not listed in the **Domain Controllers** list, detection of suspicious activities might not function as expected.

-   Make sure that the first domain controller is **not** a read-only domain controller (RODC).

    Read only domain controllers should be added only after the initial sync completes.

-   At least one domain controller in the list be a global catalog server. This will enable ATA to resolve computer and user objects in other domains in the forest.

The configuration changes will be applied to the ATA Gateway on the next scheduled sync between the ATA Gateway and the ATA Center.

### Validate installation:
To validate that the ATA Gateway has been successfully deployed, check the following:

1.  Check that the Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics Gateway service is running. After you have saved the ATA Gateway settings, it might take a few minutes for the service to start.

2.  If the service does not start, review the “Microsoft.Tri.Gateway-Errors.log” file located in the following default folder, “%programfiles%\Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics\Gateway\Logs”, search for entries with “transfer” or “service start”.

3.  Check the following Microsoft ATA Gateway performance counters:

    -   **NetworkListener Captured Messages / sec**: This counter tracks how many messages are being captured by the ATA per second. The value should be mid hundreds to thousands depending on the number of domain controllers being monitored and how busy each domain controller is. Single or double digit values can indicate an issue with the port mirroring configuration.

    -   **EntityTransfer Activity Transfers/Sec**: This value should be in the range of a few hundred every few seconds.

4.  If this is the first ATA Gateway installed, after a few minutes, log into the ATA Console and open the notification pane by swiping the right side of the screen open. You should see a list of **Entities Recently Learned** in the notification bar on the right side of the console.

5.  To validate that the installation completed successfully:

    In the console, search for something in the search bar, such as a user or a group on your domain.

    Open Performance Monitor. In the Performance tree, click on **Performance Monitor** and then click the plus icon to **Add a Counter**. Expand **Microsoft ATA Gateway** and scroll down to **Network Listener Captured Messages per Second** and add it. Then, make sure you see activity on the graph.

    ![](../Image/ATA_performance_monitoring_add_counters.png)

### <a name="ATAvpnHoneytokensetting"></a>Step 6. Configure short-term lease subnets and Honeytoken user
Short-term lease subnets are subnets in which the IP address assignment changes very rapidly - within seconds or minutes. For example, IP addresses used for your VPNs and Wi-Fi IP addresses. To enter the list of short-term lease subnets used in your organization, follow these steps:

1.  From the ATA Console on the ATA Gateway machine, click on the settings icon and select **Configuration**.

    ![](../Image/ATA_config_icon.JPG)

2.  Under **Detection**, enter the following for short-term lease subnets. Enter the short-term lease subnets using slash notation format, for example:  `192.168.0.0/24` and click the plus sign.

3.  For the Honeytoken account SIDs, enter the SID for the user account that will have no network activity, and click the plus sign. For example: `S-1-5-21-72081277-1610778489-2625714895-10511`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To find the SID for a user, run the following Windows PowerShell cmdlet `Get-ADUser UserName`.

4.  Configure exclusions: You can configure IP addresses to be excluded from specific suspicious activities. See [Working with ATA Detection Settings](../Topic/Working_with_ATA_Detection_Settings.md) for more information.

5.  Click **Save**.

![](../Image/ATA_VPN_Subnets.JPG)

Congratulations, you have successfully deployed Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics!

Check the attack time line to view detected suspicious activities and search for users or computers and view their profiles.

Remember that it takes a minimum of three weeks for ATA to build behavioral profiles, so during the first three weeks you will not see any  suspicious behavior activities.
