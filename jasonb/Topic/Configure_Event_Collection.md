# Configure Event Collection
To enhance ATA detection of Pass-the-Hash, ATA needs Windows Event log ID 4776. This can be forwarded to the ATA Gateway in one of two ways, by configuring the ATA Gateway to listen for SIEM events or by [Configuring Windows Event Forwarding](#ATA_event_WEF).

## <a name="ATASIEM"></a>Event collection
In addition to collecting and analyzing network traffic to and from the domain controllers, ATA can use Windows event 4776 to further enhance ATA Pass-the-Hash detection. This can be received from your SIEM or by  setting Windows Event Forwarding from your domain controller. Events collected provide ATA with additional information that is not available via the domain controller network traffic.

### SIEM/Syslog
For ATA to be able to consume data from a Syslog server, you need to do the following:

-   Configure one of your ATA Gateway servers to listen to and accept events forwarded from the SIEM/Sylog server.

-   Configure your SIEM/Syslog server to forward specific events to the ATA Gateway.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> -   Do not forward all the Syslog data to the ATA Gateway.
> -   ATA supports UDP traffic from the SIEM/Syslog server.

Refer to your SIEM/Syslog server's product documentation for information on how to configure forwarding of specific events to another server. For more information about the events forwarded to ATA, see [Configure Event Collection](../Topic/Configure_Event_Collection.md).

### Windows event forwarding
If you do not use a SIEM/Syslog server, you can configure your Windows domain controllers to forward Windows Event ID 4776 to be collected and analyzed by ATA. Windows Event ID 4776 provides data regarding NTLM authentications.

For more information see:  [Configuring Windows Event Forwarding](../Topic/Configuring_Windows_Event_Forwarding.md).

## Configuring the ATA Gateway to listen for SIEM events

1.  On the ATA Gateway configuration, enable **Syslog Listener UDP**.

    Set the Listening IP Address as described in the picture, below. The default port is 514.

    ![](../Image/ATA_enable_siem_forward_events.png)

2.  Configure your SIEM or Syslog server to forward Windows Event ID 4776 to the IP address selected above. For additional information on configuring your SIEM, refer to your SIEM online help or technical support options for specific formatting requirements for each SIEM server.

### SIEM support
ATA supports SIEM events in the following formats:

#### RSA Security Analytics
&lt;Syslog Header&gt;RsaSA\n2015-May-19 09:07:09\n4776\nMicrosoft-Windows-Security-Auditing\nSecurity\XXXXX.subDomain.domain.org.il\nYYYYY$\nMMMMM \n0x0

-   Syslog header is optional.

-   “\n” character separator is required between all fields.

-   The fields, in order, are:

    1.  RsaSA constant (must appear).

    2.  The timestamp of the actual event (make sure it’s not the timestamp of the arrival to the SIEM or when it’s sent to ATA). Preferably  in milliseconds accuracy, this is very important.

    3.  The windows event ID

    4.  The windows event provider name

    5.  The windows event log name

    6.  The name of the computer receiving the event (the DC in this case)

    7.  The name of the user authenticating

    8.  The name of the source host name

    9. The result code of the NTLM

-   The order is important and nothing else should be included in the message.

#### HP Arcsight
CEF:0|Microsoft|Microsoft Windows||Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing:4776|The domain controller attempted to validate the credentials for an account.|Low| externalId=4776 cat=Security rt=1426218619000 shost=KKKKKK dhost=YYYYYY.subDomain.domain.com duser=XXXXXX cs2=Security cs3=Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing cs4=0x0 cs3Label=EventSource cs4Label=Reason or Error Code

-   Must comply with the protocol definition.

-   No syslog header.

-   The header part (the part that’s separated by a pipe) must exist (as stated in the protocol).

-   The following keys in the _Extension_ part must be present in the event:

    -   externalId = the Windows event ID

    -   rt = the timestamp of the actual event (make sure it’s not the timestamp of the arrival to the SIEM or when it’s sent to us). Preferably  in milliseconds accuracy, this is very important.

    -   cat = the Windows event log name

    -   shost = the source host name

    -   dhost = the computer receiving the event (the DC in this case)

    -   duser = the user authenticating

-   The order is not important for the _Extension_ part

-   There must be a custom key and keyLable for these two fields:

    -   “EventSource”

    -   “Reason or Error Code” = The result code of the NTLM

#### Splunk
&lt;Syslog Header&gt;\r\nEventCode=4776\r\nLogfile=Security\r\nSourceName=Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing\r\nTimeGenerated=20150310132717.784882-000\r\ComputerName=YYYYY\r\nMessage=

The computer attempted to validate the credentials for an account.

Authentication Package:              MICROSOFT_AUTHENTICATION_PACKAGE_V1_0

Logon Account: Administrator

Source Workstation:       SIEM

Error Code:         0x0

-   Syslog header is optional.

-   There’s a “\r\n” character separator between all required fields.

-   The fields are in key=value format.

-   The following keys must exists and have a value:

    -   EventCode = the Windows event ID

    -   Logfile = the Windows event log name

    -   SourceName = The Windows event provider name

    -   TimeGenerated = the timestamp of the actual event (make sure it’s not the timestamp of the arrival to the SIEM or when it’s sent to ATA). The format should match yyyyMMddHHmmss.FFFFFF, preferably  in milliseconds accuracy, this is very important.

    -   ComputerName = the source host name

    -   Message = the original event text from the Windows event

-   The Message Key and value MUST be last.

-   The order is not important for the key=value pairs.

## <a name="ATA_event_WEF"></a>Configuring Windows Event Forwarding
If you do not have a SIEM server you can configure your domain controllers to forward Windows Event ID 4776 directly to one of your ATA Gateways.

1.  Log on to all domain controllers and ATA Gateway machines using a domain account with administrator privileges. 
2. Make sure all the domain controllers and ATA Gateways you are connecting are joined to the same domain.
3.	On each domain controller, type the following at an elevated command prompt:

```
winrm quickconfig
```

4.	On the ATA Gateway, type the following at an elevated command prompt:

```
wecutil qc
```

5.	On each domain controller, in **Active Directory Users and Computers**, navigate to the **Builtin** folder and double click on the **Event Log Readers** group. 
![wef_ad_eventlogreaders](/Image/wef_ad_eventlogreaders.png)
Right click on it and select **Properties**. On the **Members** tab, add the computer account of each ATA Gateway. 
![wef_ad event log reader popup](/Image/wef_ad_event_log_reader_popup.png)
6.	On the ATA Gateway, open the Event Viewer and right click on **Subscriptions** and select **Create Subscription**.  

    a.	Under **Subscription type and source computers**, click **Select Computers** and add the domain controllers and test connectivity.
    ![wef_subscription prop](/Image/wef_subscription_prop.png)
    
    b.	Under **Events to collect**, click **Select Events**. Select **By log** and scroll down to select **Security**. Then, In the **Includes/Excludes Event IDs**, type **4776**.
    ![wef_4776](/Image/wef_4776.png)
    
    c. Under **Change user account or configure advanced settings**, click **Advanced**. 
        Set the **Protocol** to **HTTP** and the **Port** to **5985**.
    ![wef_http](/Image/wef_http.png)
    
 7.	[Optional] If you want a shorter poling interval, on the ATA Gateway, set the subscription heartbeat to 5 seconds for faster polling rate.

```
wecutil ss <CollectionName>/cm:custom
wecutil ss <CollectionName> /hi:5000
```

8. On the ATA Gateway configuration page, enable **Windows Event Forwarding Collection**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you enable this setting the ATA Gateway will look in the Forwarded Events log for Windows Events that have been forwarded to it from the domain controllers.
